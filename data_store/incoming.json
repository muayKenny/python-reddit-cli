It's been an amazing project to work on and I've learned so much and met so many great people since I began writing the book. However, all good things end and this one is finishing sooner and shorter than originally planned. Don't worry though - the existing chapters are not going anywhere. They have been updated to the most recent version of three.js (r126) and I will continue to update them every couple of months. I also plan to rework some of my unpublished material and upload that when time permits.\n\nOver the past year, a combination of personal factors and ongoing global issues left me with less time than I needed to make decent progress on the book. Last December I finally decided to take a break for a few weeks and re-evaluate the project. I spent some of this time doing research and improving my workflow, and while doing this I realized there have been big changes to the three.js ecosystem over the past year. When I looked further into these I realized that many of my reasons for writing Discover three.js are no longer as important as they were when I started.\n\nThese ecosystem changes are exciting and fall into two categories: learning materials, and code. Let me take a few moments now to introduce them and explain why they led me to decide to stop writing the book.\n\nWhen I first started using three.js, there were many pain points to using the library, and the biggest of these were the incomplete documentation and out-of-date tutorials and books. Since then the docs have improved a lot, but many tutorials and books on three.js still use old and outdated versions. Due to the unusual versioning system that three.js uses, it's not clear when a tutorial or book becomes out of date and this leads to a lot of confusion for new users. This is what originally inspired me to start writing Discover three.js. I wanted to fill a gap in the available documentation and provide a clear learning path for new users. However, since then, some amazing new tutorials and courses have been released, such as [three.js Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org/), which I'm happy to recommend.\n\nMore importantly to my decision, the code ecosystem surrounding three.js has grown in leaps and bounds over the past year, led by the amazing [Poimandres](https://github.com/pmndrs) collective behind [React-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (R3F), [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), [React-three-ally](http://react-three-a11y/), and lots more (and I should also mention [vanruesc/postprocessing](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing) and [Troika three-text](https://protectwise.github.io/troika/troika-three-text/), both of which I'm a big fan of). As you can probably guess, most of this is rather React-centric. However, R3F is rapidly becoming the most common way to use three.js since it abstracts away so much of the busywork involved in creating a three.js app, and because of this, R3F lets you start creating beautiful 3D scenes much faster... as long as you know React, that is.\n\nThis left me in a quandary. Discover three.js is supposed to be a book that will teach you the best way to create 3D websites, not an exhaustive book on 3D graphic theory (there are already loads of amazing computer graphics books - some even using three.js - and it was never my goal to write another one). And yet, more and more I'm coming to believe that using pure three.js is not the fastest or best way to create a modern 3D website, in most cases. Currently, R3F is, and I hope it will inspire similar non-React projects in the future. This left me writing a book that doesn't teach the tooling that I now use and recommend.\n\nAs a result, I now feel I would be better off putting my energy into new projects. Saying goodbye to an unfinished project that I've worked so hard on is bittersweet, but it's an important step for me to take. As John Cleese would say, [Adopt, Adapt, and Improve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG9Ql1Wyxbg).\n\n## The Future of Discover three.js\n\nFundamental concepts like lighting, geometry, and mathematics work the same way no matter how you are building an app, and I still believe that anyone who wants to learn three.js should learn the basics of putting a scene together using pure three.js. I also still believe that Discover three.js in its current form is one of the best resources for learning those basics, so the existing chapters are not going anywhere. They form a complete beginner-friendly tutorial series spanning somewhere around 70,000 words, and as I mentioned above, I will keep them up to date with new three.js releases.\n\nI'm also open to the idea of open-sourcing the project. The book is written in markdown and compiled with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and if anyone is interested in continuing the book please get in touch.\n\n## Thank you for your support\n\nSo for now, this is goodbye. Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me since I started writing this book with kind words and support, and special thanks to everyone who proofread the existing chapters. You are all awesome!\n\nFinally, a couple of months ago I added a Buy me a Coffee link to the chapters in the book. I've taken this down now - many thanks to anyone who bought me a coffee. However, I did say that the money was going to be used to write the book, so I'm more than happy to refund anyone who contributed. Drop me a message if you want your coffee back :)\n\nOnwards and upwards. Wherever in the world you are, I hope you're having a great day.\n\n**Lewy**"}, {"id": "kbtm2b", "title": "After 3 long years, jamir is almost complete, thanks to three.js", "score": 60, "url": "https://gfycat.com/hilariousdefensivebabirusa", "body": ""}, {"id": "ov2eeg", "title": "I created an alternative to React-Three-Fiber.

I made it because I couldn\u2019t find any way to visually and interactively create rich, eye catching particle systems for my engine that could potentially match those made for AAA games.\n\nWith **Nebula**, you can create eye catching particle systems, save them as JSON and render them in any website or app that supports WebGL using `three` and `three-nebula`. Particles can be rendered direct to the GPU making for some extremely performant effects.\n\nAt present the app is in alpha and there may be issues, from UI bugs to performance problems, but I\u2019m pleased enough with it to let people start playing around and see what kinds of things the community can create. There\u2019s also no fully fleshed out user guide or manual right now because I\u2019m sure users will have a lot of feedback about the first draft for the UI. I\u2019d rather wait until I\u2019ve addressed the first round of major concerns before investing time into writing a guide.\n\nI\u2019ve got a lot of plans for the future, such as an online space where people can upload, view & download other people\u2019s particle systems and bunch of other advanced features that I\u2019ll talk about soon.\n\nFor now, if you have questions, comments or want to simply discuss things, please head over to the repo\u2019s [discussions](https://github.com/creativelifeform/three-nebula/discussions) page in Github.
